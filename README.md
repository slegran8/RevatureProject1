# RevatureProject1
First Revature Project Ramen Restaurant
This Restaurant REST API handles orders, logins, and meals from customers. A customer makes multiple meals that are wrapped together in which a total price is shown. The meals are inputted directly by user and the project doesn't currently have a meal table for users to easily select from. 

Technologies Used
- Visual Studio 2022
- Microsoft SQL Management Studio
- C#
- .NET Core
- ADO.NET
- Swagger
- Serilog

Future Improvements
- Iâ€™d like to turn this Project into a usable apple using the MVC system with view in which users could login, and perform normal restaurant functions
- Add a menu table to include the different bowls of ramen and be able to add various toppings and extras
- Add quantity features and other menu features
